# Bootstrap Efficiency Model

##Computational Analysis of Bootstrapped Startups

Computational implementation for the research paper **"Bootstrapped Startups in the Digital Economy: Theory and Empirical Validation"** by Spilios Dimakopoulos (August 2025).

## Research Overview

This study develops a theoretical framework for bootstrapped startups—ventures relying primarily on founder capital and reinvested profits. Through Monte Carlo simulations of 4,000 startups, the research demonstrates that resource constraints drive operational efficiency, creating distinct performance patterns compared to venture capital-funded startups.

**Key Findings:**
- Bootstrapped startups achieve efficiency scores from 28.1 to 56.2 across digital adoption levels
- Resource constraints lead to significantly higher efficiency ratios 
- Bootstrap Efficiency Model: `E = (R × LTV) / (CAC × OE) × (1 + D)`
- Strong predictive power for startup success probability (87% accuracy)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/SpiliosDimakopoulos/bootstrap-efficiency-model/
cd bootstrap-efficiency-model
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels

# Run complete analysis
python main.py
```

**Outputs:** Efficiency distributions, success probability models, sensitivity analysis results, and publication-quality visualizations in `results/` and `paper/figures/`

## Methodology

**Simulation Parameters:**
- **Bootstrapped**: CAC $500-1,500, OE $2,000-8,000 (resource constrained)
- **Funded**: CAC $200-1,000, OE $5,000-15,000 (higher operational overhead)
- **Common**: Revenue $10K-50K, LTV $1K-5K per employee

**Success Probability Model:**
```
P(Success) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(α₀ + α₁E + α₂M + α₃F)))
```
Where E=efficiency, M=market factors, F=founder characteristics

## Key Results

- **Validation**: 87% prediction accuracy with quasi-complete separation
- **Digital Impact**: 100% efficiency improvement with full digital adoption
- **Resource Optimization**: Constraints drive measurable performance advantages
